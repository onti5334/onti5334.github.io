     <p> I am proud to say I am in my final semester here at UNCO! I am so excited to graduate and take what I have learned and change the world for the better. I will miss everything that comes with college but I know that when one door closes, 
      another will open. God is good, all the time. </p>
    <p>Growing up in Colorado has been nothing but a blessing for me! I love the mountains and getting lost in the woods on a dirt trail! Being outside in the sunshine is the best place to be in my mind. I am brother to four younger sisters who I love and adore so much. I would not be the strong person I am today without the love and support from my sisters.
        The biggest goal I have in life is to one day have a family. Growing up without a father figure was very hard and therapy has helped me move past that trauma. I am already on the path God wants me to be so the biggest thing I tell myself everyday is, Keep Swimming.</p>
