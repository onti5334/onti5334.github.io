		"The hardest thing for - not only an artist but for anybody to do is look themselves in the mirror and acknowledge, you know, their own flaws and fears and imperfections and put them out there in the open for people to relate to it."
		- Kendrick Lamar
		</p>
    		<p> Kendrick Lamar is one the most influential people of this era. Mr.Duckworth reminds all of us that he is not our savior. I have to remind myself the same waking up everyday. You can't please everybody in this lifetime. </p>
    		<p>
        		List of Bullets Points on why Kendrick Lamar is my hero:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Humanity over Religion  - "Auntie Diaries" tells a story how the trans communitity deserves to be accepted. Kendrick tells the story of two transgender people, 
				                      using this narrative to critique himself, society and the churchâ€™s views on the LGBTQ community.<li>			      
        		<li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>								      
        		<li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        		<li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.
