    <h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Elijah Ontiveros</h3>
    <p>The internet is the best place to be nowadays to find everything you need. Who would have known that any information you need is right there in your pocket, accessible at any time. These are my top three places to web surf when I am bored!</p>
   

    <h2>Genius (Songs & Lyric Knowledge)</h2>
    <p>Have you ever listened to a song where you wanted to find the deeper meaning behind it? Genius is the place to go! This is my favorite website to do deeper research on my music
        My favorite song I am listening to right now is called Bad Habits by Steve Lacy. This man does not miss when it comes to creating hits! I would highly advise to take five minutes out of your day and take a listen...</p>

    <h2>All Trails: Hiking throughout CO</h2>
    <p>Colorado is the most beautiful place to hike! The way I find my trails is using All Trails!

    <h2>Google Earth</h2>
    <p> This is my favorite place to waste time on the internet! I love Google Earth and all the features it has installed.
         I remember being a little kid and hopping on to Google Earth and spending all day and night flying around to different cities!
        My whole family is from NYC so when I miss the city I decide to fly over and see all the skyscapers. I know one day I will end up 
      back in NYC, so this holds me over till then!</p>
