    <p>The internet is a great venue for humor.  This page contains some funny things that might make you laugh.</p>
   

    <h2>Genius (Songs & Lyric Knowledge)</h2>
    <p>When I think of funny videos on the web, this is usually the first one that comes to mind.  Everyone's sense of humor is different, but maybe you'll find it hilarious as well!  To save you time, this link should skip straight to where the funniness starts in the video</p>

    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
    <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
