   <blockquote>
                	<p>Our vision at The Potter’s House (TPH) is for God to mold you into a purpose-filled vessel, pointing all grace and glory back to Him. It’s our prayer that His Spirit will fully illuminate you on this heaven-bound journey, through every trial and victory. And as He empowers you to persevere through <a href="https://www.thepottershouse.org/ministries/counseling-ministry/">life’s struggles</a>, may you confidently communicate God&#8217;s vibrant hope to others — shining His eternal light on the lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I speak blessings over your family. Our prayer is that your home brightly reflects God’s joy, peace, and goodness. As His children, we are promised an abundant life: in our relationships, ministries, missions, and throughout our pilgrimage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our love for you goes beyond words. We are humbled by your continued prayers and support, and honored to serve you with <a href="https://www.thepottershouse.org/stream/">messages of revelation</a>. In this house, you are seen as a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Allow God’s rest to renew you, His mercy to move you, and His love to lead you!</p>
