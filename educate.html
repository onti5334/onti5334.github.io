        <h1>Everyone Deserves Therapy</h1>
        <p>
           I am a firm believer that everyone deserves a chance to talk to a professional (therapist) after going through a traumatic event. These TED Talks have helped open up the conversation about therapy!
            I hope these vidoes help you like they have helped me.
