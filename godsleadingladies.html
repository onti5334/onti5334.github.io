											<br><p><strong>Mission</strong>
We equip women to lead meaningful lives through faith-based enrichment programs and services.</p>
<br><p><strong>Vision</strong>
Emboldening women across the world to become visionary leaders in their professional and personal lives.</p>
<p>Inspired by the best-selling book, God&#8217;s Leading Lady: Out of the Shadows and into the Light by Bishop T.D. Jakes, God’s Leading Ladies (GLL) Life Enrichment Program provides a robust, faith-based curriculum, equipping women to chart their own path for a more fulfilling life. In 2003, First Lady Serita Jakes launched the Dallas Chapter of GLL to empower women in the areas of professional, personal, and spiritual development. To this end, thousands of women have embarked on the journey to emotional, spiritual, and mental wellness and have discovered a renewed sense of faith, courage, and joy along the way.</p>
<p>God’s Leading Ladies Life Enrichment Program is unique in its approach to meeting the diverse needs of today’s woman, as it marries achievement growth with spiritual growth. This holistic approach effectively transforms how women think and interact within their businesses, marriages, families, and relationships. Whether you aspire to become a successful entrepreneur and/or a devoted mother, among other roles, this enrichment program will prepare you for every season of life.</p>
<p>Additionally, The Potter’s House offers faith-based enrichment programs that complement God’s Leading Ladies (GLL), including Distinctively Debs, a debutante experience for young ladies, ages 10 through 17 years old. For mature women seeking a community of like-minded women to discuss topics, including sex and marriage, WomanToWoman (W2W) provides a quarterly forum under the leadership of First Lady Serita Jakes.</p>
