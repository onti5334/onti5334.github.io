    		<p> Kendrick Lamar is one the most influential people of this era. Mr.Duckworth reminds all of us that he is not our savior. I have to remind myself the same waking up everyday. You can't please everybody in this lifetime. </p>
    		<p>
        		List of reasons on why Kendrick Lamar is my hero:
    		</p>
    		<p> 1. Humanity over Religion: "Auntie Diaries" tells a story how the trans communitity deserves to be accepted. Kendrick tells the story of two transgender people, using this narrative to critique himself, society and the church’s views on the LGBTQ community.</p> 			      
        		<p> 2. Empathizes with his Listeners: Being a minority in White America is a hard task to handle at times. Kendrick Lamars music speaks for the voiceless, 
							 his music saved my life when I struggling with depression in my youth.</p>								      
        		<p> 3. "Not your Savior":	This phrase changed my life forever. Think about it... The only person you can save in your lifetime is yourself, you can not be everyone's savior.</p>	    
        		<p> 4. Inner World = Outer World: Mr.Lamar reminds us that you cant change the world until you change yourself. 
					      		The reflection of your outerworld is a direct reflection on your innerworld </p>
    
    		<p> Kendrick Lamar is a compelling and honest storyteller who never compromised on either his core sound or values, making him an unprecedented outlier in music, and more specifically, hip-hop. Kendrick Lamar is not my savior but his music saved my life. </p>
